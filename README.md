   - Detailed book profiles displayed.

3. **Update Book:**
   - Enables users to modify existing book details.
   - Changes are reflected in real-time.

4. **Delete Book:**
   - Users can delete book records when necessary.

## Technology Stack

### Backend (Spring Boot):
- **Java**: The application logic is implemented using Java programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Provides a robust and scalable framework for building backend services.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access and persistence.
- **RESTful API**: Exposes endpoints for communication with the frontend.
- **MySQL**: The database stores book information persistently.

### Frontend (React.js):
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Handles HTTP requests to interact with the backend.
- **React Router**: Facilitates navigation and routing within the application.
- **CSS/Bootstrap**: For styling and responsive design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

### Installation
# Backend (Spring Boot):

Navigate to the backend folder and run:

```bash
cd book
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Ensure your MySQL server is running, and update the `application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials.

# Frontend (React.js):

Navigate to the frontend folder and run:

```bash
cd bookweb
npm install
npm start
```

# Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database for the application.  
Update the Spring Boot `application.properties` file with your database details.

```properties
spring.application.name=book
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/book
spring.datasource.username=yourusername
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
```

# Run the Application:

- The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.
- The backend Spring Boot application will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

# API Endpoints

- `GET /api/books` - Get all books
- `POST /api/book` - Add a new book
- `PATCH /api/book/{id}` - Update book information
- `DELETE /api/book/{id}` - Delete a book
